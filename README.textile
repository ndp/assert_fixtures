h1. Assert Fixtures Test Helpers

Convenience methods to assert that you ended with with specific fixture data.
This solves the problem where you end up with a list of objects and want to
make sure they correspond to certain fixtures. This generally involves looping 
through them and using map() and making sure each one matches. If you don't 
care about the order, you end up having to sort in some way first so that you 
can traverse reasonably. It's not awful, but it'a cumbersome.

This uses method_missing to provide additional functions for each of your 
fixtures:

h3. assert_list_of_N

Example:

    assert_list_of_candy_bars [:almond_joys], CandyBar.find_nutty()
    assert_list_of_candy_bars [:almond_joys, :m_and_ms], CandyBar.find_nutty()

This asserts that the lists are the same size and have the same items. Any
difference is reported.


h3. assert_set_of_N

Example:

    assert_set_of_candy_bars [:almond_joys], CandyBar.find_nutty()
    assert_set_of_candy_bars [:almond_joys, :m_and_ms], CandyBar.find_nutty()

This asserts that the lists are the same size and have the same items, but order 
is ignored.
